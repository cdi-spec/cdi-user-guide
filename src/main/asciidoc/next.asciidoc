A lot of additional information on CDI can be found online. Regardless,
the CDI specification remains the authority for information on CDI. The
spec is less than 100 pages and is quite readable (don't worry, it's not
like your Blu-ray player manual).
Of course, it covers many details we've skipped over here.
The spec is available on the http://www.cdi-spec.org/download/[download page of the CDI Website^].

The http://cdi-spec.org[cdi-spec.org] website is probably your main entry point to learn more about CDI.
You'll find information about the spec, link to frameworks and libs supporting CDI and resource to go further on learning CDI.
